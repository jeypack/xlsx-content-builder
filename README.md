## Getting Started with Alza Product Template

Alter the TEMPLATES array inside gulpfile.js/alza-template.js to match the correct template folder naming.
Change images and cols inside container and|or remove to your need.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `gulp`

Runs the current template in the development mode.\
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `gulp dev`

Builds all templates for development to the `_temp_` folder.

### `gulp build`

Builds all templates for production to the `_build` folder.\
It correctly bundles Flexslider in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
